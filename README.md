# Gordius LG2 Setup

This repository is to keep a log of how my [Gordius LG2](http://gordius.be/midi-footcontroller-lg.php) is configured. The pedal controller has this rarely seen feature that the entire configuration can be exported (and imported) as a relatively easy to read structured text file, which makes it very good to keep in Git as a backup, and also to keep track of changes

Manual: http://gordius.be/LG_usermanual_v3_0_7.pdf

The repository is probably not interesting for anyone but myself.
